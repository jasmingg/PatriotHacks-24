                <h2>Fairfax County and the Environment</h2>
                <p>
                    In the face of global warming, it is more important than ever to keep our eco-footprint in mind, 
                    especially when buying a house in the most populated county of Virginia. With over 50% of residents driving  
                    a car as their primary mode of transportation along with 200,000+ buildings (the majority of which are residential),
                    the implications towards climate change cannot be ignored.

            </h2>
            <p>
                However, Fairfax County is working towards the reduction of carbon emissions by adopting "greener" energy practices. 
                Of course, sustainability is just one of many factors to consider when buying a house. Luckily, 
                our plan to seamlessly integrate with other real-estate companies would allow our patrons to lower 
                their eco-footprint while they browse listings based on price, home types, and more!
