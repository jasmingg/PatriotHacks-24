                In the face of global warming, it is more important than ever to keep our eco-footprint in mind, 
                especially when buying a house in the most populated county of Virginia.

                Of course, sustainability is just one of many factors to consider when buying a house. Luckily, 
                our plan to seamlessly integrate with other real-estate companies would allow our patrons to lower 
                their eco-footprint while they browse listings based on price, home types, and more!
